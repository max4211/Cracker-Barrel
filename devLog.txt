Cracker Barrel Development Log

9/3 Ported Java code over to python, got basic game structure operational

9/4 Explored optimization techniques by hand. Decided to create naive version to benchmark aagainst incremental optimizations.

Ran into stack overflow limit for python, attempting to raise limit or try tail call optimization techniques

Raising recursion limit failes (stack overflow memory error reached somewhere between 5000 and 6000)- lets try tail code optimizaiton

Attempting tail code optimization, need to debug try catch statements (pylint syntax errors thrown)

Next steps - explore tail code optimization (fix try catch), but ensure that recursion works with a smaller board (3 and 4 rows). Also dig deeper into what is actually overflowing, what is python stack, etc.

9/8 Continuing to debug recursion error by making smaller board. Looks like the recursion is not working as expected (moves are not always correct too and they are also not made). Now moves are correct, but moves are not correctly tracked/printed. This seems tough to debug
