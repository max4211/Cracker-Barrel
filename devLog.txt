Cracker Barrel Development Log

9/3 Ported Java code over to python, got basic game structure operational

9/4 Explored optimization techniques by hand. Decided to create naive version to benchmark aagainst incremental optimizations.

Ran into stack overflow limit for python, attempting to raise limit or try tail call optimization techniques

Raising recursion limit failes (stack overflow memory error reached somewhere between 5000 and 6000)- lets try tail code optimizaiton

Attempting tail code optimization, need to debug try catch statements (pylint syntax errors thrown)
